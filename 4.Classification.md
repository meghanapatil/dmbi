1. A table below shows a sample dataset of whether a customer responds to the survey or not. “Outcome” is a class label. Construct a Decision tree classifier for the dataset. For a new example ( Rural, semidetached, low, No)  what will be the predicted class.

2. Brifly explain Bagging and Boosting of the Classfiers


3. Define Classification, Issues of Classification and Explain ID3 classfication with example.
Classification:
Classification is a data mining function that assigns items in a collection to target categories or classes. The goal of classification is to accurately predict the target class for each case in the data. For example, a classification model could be used to identify loan applicants as low, medium, or high credit risks.

A classification task begins with a data set in which the class assignments are known. For example, a classification model that predicts credit risk could be developed based on observed data for many loan applicants over a period of time. In addition to the historical credit rating, the data might track employment history, home ownership or rental, years of residence, number and type of investments, and so on. Credit rating would be the target, the other attributes would be the predictors, and the data for each customer would constitute a case.

Classifications are discrete and do not imply order. Continuous, floating-point values would indicate a numerical, rather than a categorical, target. A predictive model with a numerical target uses a regression algorithm, not a classification algorithm.
Issues of classification:

Classification and Prediction Issues
The major issue is preparing the data for Classification and Prediction. Preparing the data involves the following activities −

Data Cleaning − Data cleaning involves removing the noise and treatment of missing values. The noise is removed by applying smoothing techniques and the problem of missing values is solved by replacing a missing value with most commonly occurring value for that attribute.

Relevance Analysis − Database may also have the irrelevant attributes. Correlation analysis is used to know whether any two given attributes are related.

Data Transformation and reduction − The data can be transformed by any of the following methods.

Normalization − The data is transformed using normalization. Normalization involves scaling all values for given attribute in order to make them fall within a small specified range. Normalization is used when in the learning step, the neural networks or the methods involving measurements are used.

Generalization − The data can also be transformed by generalizing it to the higher concept. For this purpose we can use the concept hierarchies.

Note − Data can also be reduced by some other methods such as wavelet transformation, binning, histogram analysis, and clustering.
4. Explain different methods that can be used to evaluate and compare accuracy of different classfication algorthms.


5. Use any classification techniques and find out the class of (Homeowner = Yes, Status = Employed , Income = Average)

ID,Homeowner,Status,Income, Defaulted
1,Yes,Employed,High,No,
2,No,Business,Average,NO
3,No,Employed,Low,No
4,Yes,Business,High,No
5,No,Unemployed,Average,Yes
6,No,Business,Low,No
7,Yes,Unemployed,High,No
8,No,Employed,Average,Yes
9,No,Business,Low,No
10,No,Employed,Average,Yes
